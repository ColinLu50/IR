## Problem 1

>  If there are 100 lines in the grating, what is the smallest detectable change in motor-shaft angle?

$\frac{360}{100} = 3.6 $

## Problem 2

> Explain how to determine the rotation directions if the following encoders are used.

We can check which channel produce the rising edged .

>  List two concerns while choosing an encoder.

Resolution and Number of channels

## Problem 3

- synchronized

  3 satellites

- unsynchronized

  4 satellites. (Assume that the all satellites are in synchronization)

  Reason: In addition to x,y,z, there is a synchronization time error to be calculated. So four equations are required.

Do not consider the synchronization error:

The red circle line is real position and the filled blue circle is calculated position

Consider the synchronization 

The calculated result is the same as the original position.
